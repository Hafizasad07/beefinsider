                In August, Zoetis released Valcor™ (<span class="fst-italic">doramectin and levamisole injection</span>), the first
                and only combination endetocide in the United States designed for use against
                internal and external parasites in cattle. This prescription injectable product has
                the strength of two active ingredients to treat and control adult stage and L<sub>4</sub>
                stage of Haemonchus placei, Cooperia spp. and Ostertagia ostertagi (including
                inhibited L<sub>4</sub>), as well as the adult stage of Nematodirus helvetianus. It is also
                indicated for the treatment and control of lungworms, eyeworms, grubs, mange
                mites and sucking lice. Contact your Zoetis representative for more information.

                With the influx of cattle entering the feedlot in fall and winter, resources are

                    15 days of slaughter. Not for use in female dairy cattle 20 months of age
                    or older, including dry dairy cows; not for use in beef calves less than 2
                    months of age, dairy calves, and veal calves. Safety has not been evaluated
                    in breeding bulls. Use with caution in cattle treated with cholinesterase
                    inhibitors. This product is likely to cause injection site swelling; tissue damage
